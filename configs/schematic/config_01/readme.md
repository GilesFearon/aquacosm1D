physics - manual generation of input netcdf files with grid and diffusivity

aquacosm_01 - initial tests using Sverdrup, constant ini of 1 mg/m3, K=20mg/m3

aquacosm_02 - using Bioshading_onlyC, sensitivity tests to time-step

aquacosm_03 - as per 02, increased CrowdingHalfSaturation Ch=125 

aquacosm_04 - as per 01, contant ini of 0.1 mg/m3, K = 2 mg/m3

aquacosm_05 - as per 02 but using settings to yield similar growth to 03
